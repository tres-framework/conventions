Indentation and line length
===========================

## Indentation
Use an indent of 4 spaces with no tabs.

## Line length
Soft limit: 80
Hard limit: 120

Try to keep your line length within the soft limit. You may not exceed the 
hard limit.

Tip: some text editors like Sublime Text have to option to show rulers
(vertical lines), so you can easily see where your limit is.

For Sublime Text, add the follwing in the user settings:
```"rulers": [80, 120]```
